  #Write a program that uses a hash to store a list of movie titles with the year they came out. 
  #Then use the puts command to make your program print out the year of each movie to the screen. 
  #The output for your program should look something like this.
  
  a = { :FWilly => '1995' , 
        :Simpsons => '2002', 
        :titanic => '1998'}
  #To output answer to (3):
  puts a [:titanic], 
       a [:FWilly], 
       a [:Simpsons]
